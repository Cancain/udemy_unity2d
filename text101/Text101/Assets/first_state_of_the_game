As i slowly became consious, before my eyes could adjust to beeing open i could hear the rumbling sounds of a cart rolling by. The first i could see was a handfull of townspeople hurriedly moving towards the town centre.
After a moment of gathering my strength, with a little help from the wall who had been my neckrest for the night I got up on my feet.

1. Move towards the town centre
2. Stay and rest for a while
