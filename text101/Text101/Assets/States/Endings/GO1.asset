  storyText: "After a long drag around the town mud the guard drags me though a hallway
    filled with guards who seem disgusted by my mere existance. \nAn other guard
    with a much smaller build and not all dressed in any kind of armor follows along
    for the last moments of my humiliating  drag along the hallway floor. The small
    guard picks upp a huge chain of keys as we enter the catacombs and unlocks what
    i would guess will be my permanent stay. \n\nWith a loud thump the guard throws
    me into the cell, locks the door and after just a small painful gaze they both
    turn around and leave.\nThe cell stinks of shit and dead rats. I can hear the
    screams and moaning of my neighbours... \n\nI know for sure now, there is no
    way out...\n\nPress \"1\" to restart"
