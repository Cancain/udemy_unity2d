  storyText: "As i sneak up on a smelly stall with the finest of cheeses I quickly
    grab a wedge and put it into my satchel and sneak away most likely unnoticed.
    \nBut as I am almost out of the town-center i hear a cling-clang and a heavy
    gauntlet grabs my shoulder from behind.\n- \"Well, well... what do we have here.
    Another usless piece of filth ruining this once glorious town\"\nThe guard said
    as he spat on the ground. \n\n-\"'I'm afraid i will have to lock you up, can't
    have the likes of you stealing and ruining out great town!\"\n\n1. Take my chance
    and run away out of town... Forever!\n2. Surrender to the guard"
