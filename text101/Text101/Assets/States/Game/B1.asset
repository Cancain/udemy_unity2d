  storyText: 'The guards drags me violently in the mud, dirtying my already filthy
    clothes. On the way to the prison townspeople take their chance to spit and throw
    rotten food at me.

    As i look up on the guards sheath i see a dagger on the
    fringe of falling out.


    1. Try to steal the knife and escape

    2. There
    is no way I''m getting out of this situation with just a knife, off to prison
    I go!'
