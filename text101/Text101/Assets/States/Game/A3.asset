  storyText: "Sitting down again, as i was just about to fall asleep I  hear the
    clank of heavy armor approaching. \nWhen i open my eyes i see a heavy set guard
    looking down upon me with a judgemental smirk on his face.\n\n- \"Well, well...
    what do we have here. Another usless piece of filth ruining this once glorious
    town\"\nThe guard said as he spat on the ground. \n\n-\"'I'm afraid i will have
    to lock you up, can't have the likes of you rotting about\"\n\n1. Take my chance
    and run away!\n2. Surrender to the guard"
